CellML Metadata Framework Specification 2.0
===========================================

This is the specification for the CellML Metadata Framework 2.0. It describes how semantic annotations should be made about mathematical models encoded in the CellML (www.cellml.org) format, and their elements.

The framework specification was primarily written in 2010 and considered as a draft for several years, with minor updates informed by experience gained "in the field" being made when required. 

The CellML Metadata Framework 2.0 is modular and consists of a Core specification, followed by several sub-specifications, each designed to cater for annotation in a different context. The specifications that make up this framework are detailed as follows.
